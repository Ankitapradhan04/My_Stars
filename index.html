    <h3>üéºPromiseüéº</h3>

    <p>
      I'm sitting alone, only my mind wanders
Since when did you start hurting me?
See, you don‚Äôt even know</p>
<p>You're hurting me too cause you're mine
I just want to blow your mind
We're drifting apart again
"I don't even feel it" That's what I say
But to be honest that's not it</p>

<p>I want you to be your light, baby
You should be your light
So that you won't be in pain
So you can smile
I want you to be your night, baby
You could be your night
I'll be honest with you tonight</p>

<p>You're hurting too 'cause you're mine
I just want to blow your mind
We're drifting apart again
"I don't feel it" That's what I say
But to be honest that's not it</p>

<p>I want you to be your light, baby
You should be your light
So that you won't be in pain
So you can smile
I want you to be your night, baby
You could be your night
I'll be honest with you tonight</p>

<p>Now promise me, oh, oh
Several times a day, oh, oh
Though you feel alone, oh, oh
Don't throw yourself away, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's top for a moment
Pinkie promise me
Just promise me, oh, oh</p>
